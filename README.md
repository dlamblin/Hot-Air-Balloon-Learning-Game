# Hot Air Balloon Learning Game
This is the repository for Sophie's customizable game for learning with a hot
air balloon theme.

## Intent
This contains the materials to make board game for 2+ players who will challenge
each other to answer questions as they progress. Correct anwsers permit faster
movement. The first player to the finish wins. The game is a study aid and was
developed within the guidelines of a science project submission. The primary
feature of the game is that ANY subject questions may be used, and players can
compose new sets of questions in advance of play; it is recommended to tune the
questions to the grade level of the players.
