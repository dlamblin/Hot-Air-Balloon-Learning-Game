# [Hot Air Balloon Learning Game](https://dlamblin.github.io/Hot-Air-Balloon-Learning-Game/)
This is the repository for Sophie's customizable game for learning with a hot
air balloon theme.

## Intent
This contains the materials to make the board game for 2+ players who will
challenge each other to answer questions as they progress. Correct answers
permit faster movement. The first player to the finish wins. The game is a
study aid and was developed within the guidelines of a science project
submission. The primary feature of the game is that ANY subject questions may be
used, and players can compose new sets of questions in advance of play; it is
recommended to tune the questions to the grade level of the players.

## 40 Example Questions
We have [40 Questions](questions/Questions40.pdf) as an example.
10 each for the 4 categories: 수학, 영어, 과학, 국어.

## Extending with fresh questions
Please be encouraged to write questions for your own play and learning group.
You can find a template for writing question cards at the following link:

## Making the Board Game
### You'll need:
- An A2 or larger board
- 40 spaces, in 4 colors (10 of each color)
- 2 extra spaces in a single 5th color
- 40 more pieces, or stickers, of the same 4 colors as spaces
- 40 cards; ideally 4 card sheets of 10 business cards for questions to start
- a six sided die
- multiple player pieces, Sophie used 4 magnetized "pins" as you'd used to
  hold notes to a fridge, but upright.
- crafting supplies: glue or glue stick, scissors, some color pencils.

### Now make:
#### The board
Glue 2 similarly colored A4 color papers to the board to cover it with a color.
Draw and cut out some hot air balloons or any design you like. Color it and
glue them around the board.
#### The path
Cut all the spaces to the same size. Sophie picked about 2-3cm to a side.
Place the 5th color home square as the starting piece and alternate other colors
so that no two colors are next to each other, but that no more than 6 square
seperate the same color repeating; then end with the final piece with the same
color as the home piece. Glue all these pieces in place to your board.
Overlapping a little is allowed. The path may go over the designs you made.
##### Why 40 + 2 squares?
Sophie tested rolling, reading, and answering a question. She found it takes
between 30 seconds to a minute per turn. She wanted that a game of two players
should last about 30 minutes or less. So we knew we needed about 15+ turns per
player. She also tested rolling hundreds of rolls. After collecting data and
simulating it, she found that fifteen rolls most often sums up to the total
of 42. This is how she chose to make the path 42 squares long.
#### The question cards
Use the template linked above to write at least 40 questions in four themes.
Print this onto print-at-home business card sheets; Sophie used Formtec IE3700
sheets which are 10 cards at 9cm by 5cm each.
If you have 40 stickers of the same colors as your spaces stick the correct
color to the back of each card; otherwise glue the extra color paper to each
back. This divides your cards into the 4 subject decks.

You should be ready to play now.
## Playing the Board Game
### Setup
Place a player piece for each player on home, separate the question cards
into 4 same colored decks and put them face down outside the board.
Let the youngest player start.
### Taking your turn
The player will roll a die, and move that many spaces along the path. The
next player will then challenge the current player with a question from
the deck of the same color that the player landed on. The player gets one
chance to answer correctly. There is no time limit unless all players
agreed to one in advance. Resolution after being right or wrong depends on
the game mode chosen for this play.
#### Fast game play
If you've opted to play a fast game, a wrong answer means the player stays
where they landed, while a right answer means they can move forward to the next
space of the same color. Their turn ends here.
#### Test mode
If you're playing test mode, a wrong answer means you move back to where you
were before your roll, while a rigth answer means you can stay where you landed.
The turn ends.
#### Exam mode
If you're playing in exam mode, a wrong answer sends the player back to the home
square. A right answer lets them stay where they landed; either ends the turn.

Play of any mode continues with the next player being the player
counter-clockwise of the current player. If any player _unfairly_ gives another
player the answer their next turn is skipped.

### Winning
The first player to land or pass the final space is the winner. As there is no
card the same color as the final space, once rolled it is safe to land on or
pass in any mode.

## Frequent Play
Please keep play fresh by asking a parent, teacher, tutor, or older sibling to
help write fresh question cards by each subject for every 4 to 8 games played.
