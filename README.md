# [Hot Air Balloon Learning Game](https://dlamblin.github.io/Hot-Air-Balloon-Learning-Game/)
This is the repository for Sophie's customizable game for learning with a hot
air balloon theme.

## Intent
This contains the materials to make the board game for 2+ players who will
challenge each other to answer questions as they progress. Correct answers
permit faster movement. The first player to the finish wins. The game is a
study aid and was developed within the guidelines of a science project
submission. The primary feature of the game is that ANY subject questions may be
used, and players can compose new sets of questions in advance of play; it is
recommended to tune the questions to the grade level of the players.

## 40 Example Questions
We have [40 Questions](questions/Questions40.pdf) as an example.
10 each for the 4 categories: 수학, 영어, 과학, 국어.

## Extending with fresh questions
Please be encouraged to write questions for your own play and learning group.
You can find a template for writing question cards at the following link:

## Making the Board
### You'll need:
- An A2 or larger board
- 40 spaces, in 4 colors (10 of each color)
- 2 extra spaces in a single 5th color
- 40 more pieces, or stickers, of the same 4 colors as spaces
- 40 cards; idealy 4 card sheets of 10 business cards for questions to start
- a six sided die
- multiple player pieces, Sophie used 4 magnetized "pins" as you'd used to
  hold notes to a frige, but upright.
- crafting supplies: glue or glue stick, scissors, some color pencils.

### Now make:
#### The board
Glue 2 similarly colored A4 color papers to the board to cover it with a color.
Draw and cut out some hot air balloons or any design you like. Color it and
glue them around the board.
#### The path
Cut all the spaces to the same size. Sophie picked about 2-3cm to a side.
Place the 5th color home square as the starting piece and alternate other colors
so that no two colors are next to each other, but that no more than 6 square
seperate the same color repeating; then end with the final piece with the same
color as the home piece. Glue all these pieces in place to your board.
Overlapping a little is allowed. The path may go over the designs you made.
##### Why 40 + 2 squares?
Sophie tested rolling, reading, and answering a question. She found it takes
between 30 seconds to a minute per turn. She wanted that a game of two players
should last about 30 minutes or less. So we knew we needed about 15+ turns per
player. She also tested rolling hundreds of rolls. After collecting data and
simulating it, she found that fifteen rolls most often sums up to the total of
42. This is how she chose to make the path 42 squares long.
#### The question cards
Use the template linked above to write at least 40 questions in four themes.
Print this onto print-at-home business card sheets; Sophie used Formtec IE3700
sheets which are 10 cards at 9cm by 5cm each.
If you have 40 stickers of the same colors as your spaces stick the correct
color to the back of each card; otherwise glue the extra color paper to each
back. This devides your cards into the 4 subject decks.

You should be ready to play now.
